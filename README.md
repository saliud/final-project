# final-project
Finals has me super stressed. I have a 10 page paper to write, single spaced, a marketing exam worth 20% of my grade, and a whole website that is due next week that I havent even started adding jquery / animation effects too. So yeah, it's pretty stressful but thats okay ill get it done once i stop procrasinating ahaha.
